### Hi there

My name is Łukasz, and I’m into web development and writing (of fiction and technical documentation).


### Web development

I work primarily in React. Here’s a bunch of my projects:
- [My official writing website](https://github.com/ldrobnik/drobnik-writing)
- [Literary magazine](https://github.com/ldrobnik/blyski) featuring flash fiction
- [Website advertising my translation services](https://github.com/ldrobnik/medical-translations)
- [Tool to search the NASA exoplanet archive](https://github.com/ldrobnik/exoplanets) (an older project I’m currently reworking)
- [Website advertising English-teaching services for psychologists](https://github.com/ldrobnik/angielski-w-psychologii)

### Fiction
