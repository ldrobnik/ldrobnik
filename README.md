### Hi there

My name is Łukasz, and I’m a technical and fiction writer. In my spare time, I develop web apps.

### Web development

Most of my web projects are React-based apps. Here’s a selection:
- [My official writing website](https://github.com/ldrobnik/drobnik-writing)
- [Literary magazine](https://github.com/ldrobnik/blyski) I set up to popularise flash fiction in Poland
- [Website advertising translation services](https://github.com/ldrobnik/medical-translations)
- [Tool to search the NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://github.com/ldrobnik/exoplanets) (an older project I’m currently reworking)
- [Website advertising English-teaching services for psychologists](https://github.com/ldrobnik/angielski-w-psychologii)

### Technical writing

I work as a junior technical writer / JS developer at [CKSource](https://cksource.com/). In 2021, I finished a postgraduate [technical communication course](https://www.vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/kontynuacja-edukacji/studia-podyplomowe/informatyka/komunikacja-techniczna) at Vistula University in Warsaw.
You can take a look at samples of my technical writing:
- [Markdown-based guide to selected technical communication tools, built with Docusaurus](https://tech-comm-starter-pack.netlify.app/)
- [DITA-based guide to preparing DITA content for localization](https://prepare-dita-for-l10n.netlify.app/)
- [Introduction to Markdown for creative writers](https://drobnik.co/blog/markdown-for-creative-writers)
- [UX copy and other content for my author website](https://drobnik.co/)
